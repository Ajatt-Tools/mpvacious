# Use FFmpeg encoder instead of mpv encoder
# If mpvacious encounters problems creating audio and images for Anki cards,
# setting this to `yes` should fix them.
#
# You need to install ffmpeg and add it to the PATH first.

## Image settings
##

# Snapshot format.
# Do not switch to `jpg` unless your computer doesn't support `webp` or `avif`.
snapshot_format=avif
#snapshot_format=webp
#snapshot_format=jpg

# Quality of produced image files. 0 = lowest, 100=highest.
snapshot_quality=15

# Image dimensions
# If either (but not both) of the width or height parameters is -2,
# the value will be calculated preserving the aspect-ratio.
snapshot_width=-2
snapshot_height=350

# Screenshot (yes, no)
# Usually not required.
# When making Anki cards, create a screenshot (by calling 'screenshot-to-file') instead of a snapshot.
# If set to yes, image dimensions and quality cannot be controlled due to mpv limitations.
# 'snapshot_format' is still respected.
# When using this, a custom sync server is recommended, e.g. https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server
screenshot=no

# The exact image template used when exporting to Anki's image field.
# Adding data-editor-shrink="true" makes the image smaller by default within the Anki viewer
# on versions 2.1.53+ (equivalent of double-clicking on the image).
# You likely would not want to change this unless you know what you are doing.
image_template=<img alt="snapshot" src="%s">
#image_template=<img alt="snapshot" data-editor-shrink="true" src="%s">

# Similar to image_template but with audio.
# Normally, the user doesn't need to change this setting,
# but it may be needed for audio files to be playable on AnkiWeb.
audio_template=[sound:%s]
#audio_template=<audio controls="" src="%s"></audio>

##
## Animated snapshots
## Animated snapshots will capture the video from the start to the end times selected when using mpvacious.
##

# If enabled, generates animated snapshots (something like GIFs) instead of static snapshots.
animated_snapshot_enabled=no

# Animated snapshot format. Like "snapshot_format" but for animated images. Can be either avif or webp.
animated_snapshot_format=avif
#animated_snapshot_format=webp

# Number of frame per seconds, a value between 0 and 30 (30 included)
# Higher values will increase both quality and file size, lower values will do the opposite
animated_snapshot_fps=10

# Animated snapshot dimensions
# If either (but not both) of the width or height parameters is -2,
# the value will be calculated preserving the aspect-ratio.
animated_snapshot_width=-2
animated_snapshot_height=200

# Quality of the produced animation, 0 = lowest, 100 = highest
animated_snapshot_quality=5

##
## Audio settings
##

# Audio format.
# Opus is the recommended format.
audio_format=opus
#audio_format=mp3

# Container for opus files.
# It may be required to use a different container for Opus.
# This is the case on certain computers or devices
# which are running proprietary operating systems, e.g. AnkiMobile. Using them is discouraged.
# ・ Ogg/Opus play everywhere except AnkiWeb in Safari and AnkiMobile.
# ・ M4A (iOS 17.2 and probably even earlier) and WEBM (since iOS 17.4) play everywhere.
# ・ Opus in CAF can be used with older iOS. CAF plays only on Anki Desktop, Safari and AnkiMobile.
# ・ (iOS Lockdown Mode disables Opus support completely,
#    though you may try to add an exception for AnkiMobile.)
opus_container=ogg
#opus_container=opus
#opus_container=m4a
#opus_container=webm
#opus_container=caf

# Sane values are 16k-32k for opus, 64k-128k for mp3.
audio_bitrate=24k

# Set a pad to the dialog timings. 0.5 = half a second.
# Pads are never applied to manually set timings.
audio_padding=0.0
#audio_padding=0.5

##
## Forvo support (Rikaitan users only)
##

# yes    - fetch audio from Forvo if Rikaitan couldn't find the audio (default)
# always - always fetch audio from Forvo and replace the audio added by Rikaitan
# no     - never use Forvo
use_forvo=yes

# Vocab field should be equal to {expression} field in Rikaitan
vocab_field=VocabKanji

# Vocab Audio field should be equal to {audio} field in Rikaitan
vocab_audio_field=VocabAudio

##
## Misc info
## Various context information that can be written on your cards in a specified field.
##

# yes to enable or no to disable.
miscinfo_enable=yes

# Field name
miscinfo_field=Notes

# Format string used to fill the misc info field.
# It supports the same substitutions as `note_tag`. HTML is supported.
miscinfo_format=%n EP%d (%t)
#miscinfo_format=From <b>mpvacious</b> %n at %t.

##
## Secondary subtitles
## Mpvacious can try automatically loading secondary subtitles that will appear at the top.
## For example, you may want to load English subs alongside Japanese subs.
##
## Secondary subtitles should be present in the container.
## But if you manually set secondary sid from the command line, mpvacious won't change it.
##

# Load secondary subtitle track automatically when a file is opened.
secondary_sub_auto_load=yes

# Language of secondary subs. This is your native language or a language you know well.
# If you leave this parameter empty, secondary subs will NOT be automatically loaded.
secondary_sub_lang=eng,en,rus,ru
#secondary_sub_lang=

# Hover area.
# Proportion of the top part of the mpv window where the secondary subtitles are visible when hovered over.
# Possible values: from 0.0 to 1.0
secondary_sub_area=0.15

# Visibility state
# Can be set to: 'auto', 'never', 'always'.
# If set to 'never' or 'always', secondary_sub_area has no effect.
# If set to 'auto', visibility behaves according to the value of secondary_sub_area.
# Default binding to cycle this value: Ctrl+v.
secondary_sub_visibility=auto

# Perform two-pass loudness normalization.
# Parameter explanation can be found e.g. at:

# MAKE SURE TO REMOVE loudnorm FROM CUSTOM ARGS BEFORE ENABLING.
loudnorm=no
loudnorm_target=-16
loudnorm_range=11
loudnorm_peak=-1.5

##
## Custom audio encoding arguments
## These arguments are added to the command line.
## `mpv` and `ffmpeg` accept slightly different parameters.
## Feel free to experiment for yourself, but be careful or media creation might stop working.
##

# loudnorm IN CUSTOM ARGS IS LEFT FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.
# MAKE SURE TO REMOVE ALL MENTIONS OF loudnorm FROM CUSTOM ARGS
# (E.G. SET TO EMPTY STRINGS) BEFORE ENABLING TWO-PASS loudnorm.
# ENABLING loudnorm BOTH THROUGH THE SWITCH AND THROUGH CUSTOM ARGS
# CAN LEAD TO UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.

##
## Custom Sub Filter
## Place a `subs2srs_sub_filter.lua` file
## in the `~/.config/mpv/subs2srs_sub_filter` directory.
## The custom script must return a table
## that includes either of a `preprocess` or a `trim` function (or both).
##
## - `preprocess(text)`: Executes before trimming/cleaning.
## - `trim(text)`: Replaces the built-in trimming logic.
##

# Enable custom sub preprocessing by default (yes, no)
custom_sub_filter_enabled=no

# Notification prefix for toggle
custom_sub_filter_notification=Custom Sub Filter

# Use a custom trim instead of the built in one (yes, no)

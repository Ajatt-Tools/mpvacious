# The tag(s) added to new notes. Spaces separate multiple tags.
# Leave nothing after `=` to disable tagging completely.
# The following substitutions are supported:
#   %n - the name of the video

##
## Toggleables.
## Possible values: `yes` or `no`.
##

# Use FFmpeg encoder instead of mpv encoder
# If mpvacious encounters problems creating audio and images for Anki cards,
# setting this to `yes` should fix them.
#
# You need to install ffmpeg and add it to the PATH first.
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/FFmpeg
# https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
#
# FFmpeg encoder is unable to create audio and images from remote content (like YouTube videos).
use_ffmpeg=no

# Automatically create the deck for new cards (see deck_name option)
create_deck=yes

# Allow making notes with the same sentence field.
allow_duplicates=no

# When mpv starts, automatically copy subs to the clipboard as they appear on screen.
# This option can be also toggled in the addon's OSD menu.
autoclip=no

# Remove all spaces from the primary subtitle text.
# Set this to "yes" for languages without spaces like Japanese.
# However, if mpvacious detects any latin characters in the string, spaces will not be removed.
nuke_spaces=yes

# if set to `yes`, the volume of the outputted audio file
# depends on the volume of the player at the time of export
tie_volumes=no

# Remove text in parentheses and leading/trailing spaces or
# newlines that may interfere with Yomichan before copying
# subtitles to the clipboard

# Remove text in brackets before substituting %n into tag

# Remove the episode number before substituting %n into tag
tag_del_episode_num=yes

# Remove everything after the episode number before substituting %n into tag
# Does nothing if the previous option tag_del_episode_num is disabled.

# after note creation (or note update) to ensure that the audio is correctly cut.

# When selecting subtitle lines, print them on the screen.
show_selected_text=yes

# For convenience, read config file from disk before a card is made.
# Useful if you change your config often since you won't have to restart mpv every time,
# but reading from disk takes some time.

## Image settings
##

# Snapshot format.
# Do not switch to `jpg` unless your computer doesn't support `webp`.
snapshot_format=webp
#snapshot_format=jpg

# Quality of produced image files. 0 = lowest, 100=highest.
snapshot_quality=15

# Image dimensions
# If either (but not both) of the width or height parameters is -2,
# the value will be calculated preserving the aspect-ratio.
snapshot_width=-2
snapshot_height=200

# Screenshot (yes, no)
# Usually not required.
# When making Anki cards, create a screenshot (by calling 'screenshot-to-file') instead of a snapshot.
# If set to yes, image dimensions and quality cannot be controlled due to mpv limitations.
# 'snapshot_format' is still respected.
# When using this, a custom sync server is recommended, e.g. https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server
screenshot=no

# The exact image template used when exporting to Anki's image field.
# Adding data-editor-shrink="true" makes the image smaller by default within the Anki viewer
# on versions 2.1.53+ (equivalent of double-clicking on the image).
# You likely would not want to change this unless you know what you are doing.
image_template=<img alt="snapshot" src="%s">
#image_template=<img alt="snapshot" data-editor-shrink="true" src="%s">

## Animated snapshots
## Animated snapshots will capture the video from the start to the end times selected when using mpvacious.
##

# If enabled, generates animated snapshots (something like GIFs) instead of static snapshots.
animated_snapshot_enabled=no

# Number of frame per seconds, a value between 0 and 30 (30 included)
# Higher values will increase both quality and file size, lower values will do the opposite
animated_snapshot_fps=10

# Animated snapshot dimensions
# If either (but not both) of the width or height parameters is -2,
# the value will be calculated preserving the aspect-ratio.
animated_snapshot_width=-2
animated_snapshot_height=200

# Quality of the produced animation, 0 = lowest, 100 = highest
animated_snapshot_quality=5

##
## Audio settings
##

# Audio format.
# Do not switch to `mp3` unless your computer doesn't support `opus`.
audio_format=opus
#audio_format=mp3

# Sane values are 16k-32k for opus, 64k-128k for mp3.
audio_bitrate=24k

# Set a pad to the dialog timings. 0.5 = half a second.
# Pads are never applied to manually set timings.
audio_padding=0.0
#audio_padding=0.5

##
## Forvo support (Yomichan users only)
##

# yes    - fetch audio from Forvo if Yomichan couldn't find the audio (default)
# always - always fetch audio from Forvo and replace the audio added by Yomichan
# no     - never use Forvo
use_forvo=yes

# Vocab field should be equal to {expression} field in Yomichan
vocab_field=VocabKanji

# Vocab Audio field should be equal to {audio} field in Yomichan
vocab_audio_field=VocabAudio

##
## Misc info
## Various context information that can be written on your cards in a specified field.
##

# yes to enable or no to disable.
miscinfo_enable=yes

# Field name
miscinfo_field=Notes

# Format string used to fill the misc info field.
# It supports the same substitutions as `note_tag`. HTML is supported.
miscinfo_format=%n EP%d (%t)
#miscinfo_format=From <b>mpvacious</b> %n at %t.

##
## Secondary subtitles
## Mpvacious can try automatically loading secondary subtitles that will appear at the top.
## For example, you may want to load English subs alongside Japanese subs.
##
## Secondary subtitles should be present in the container.
## But if you manually set secondary sid from the command line, mpvacious won't change it.
##

# Language of secondary subs.
# If you leave this parameter empty, no secondary subs will be automatically loaded.
secondary_sub_lang=eng,en,rus,ru,bel,be
#secondary_sub_lang=

# Hover area.
# Proportion of the top part of the mpv window where the secondary subtitles are visible when hovered over.
# Possible values: from 0.0 to 1.0
secondary_sub_area=0.15

# Visibility state
# Can be set to: 'auto', 'never', 'always'.
# If set to 'never' or 'always', secondary_sub_area has no effect.
# If set to 'auto', visibility behaves according to the value of secondary_sub_area.
# Default binding to cycle this value: Ctrl+v.
secondary_sub_visibility=auto

##
## Custom audio encoding arguments
## These arguments are added to the command line.
## `mpv` and `ffmpeg` accept slightly different parameters.
## Feel free to experiment for yourself, but be careful or media creation might stop working.
##

# Ffmpeg
ffmpeg_audio_args=-af loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11
#ffmpeg_audio_args=-af silenceremove=1:0:-50dB

# mpv
# mpv accepts each filter as a separate argument, e.g. --af-append=1 --af-append=2
mpv_audio_args=--af-append=loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11
#mpv_audio_args=--af-append=silenceremove=1:0:-50dB

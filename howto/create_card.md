# Make a simple sentence card

To make a card from the currently visible subtitle line, press <kbd>Ctrl+n</kbd>.

To make a card from two or more subtitle lines:

1) Press <kbd>a</kbd> to open advanced menu.
2) Press <kbd>c</kbd> to start interactive selection.
3) Seek to the previous/next subtitle with <kbd>Shift+h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+l</kbd>.
4) Press <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new card.

After the card is created, you can find it by typing `added:1` in the Anki Browser.
The card doesn't contain dictionary definitions.
You need to add them yourself afterward, using software like GoldenDict, Qolibri, etc.

# Update a selected card

This is particularly useful if you want to update a card
that you created some time ago and has some reviews on it already.

You might run into a situation when you see a better fit, whether it's media
or new subs that make make it easier to understand.

To update a card from the currently visible subtitle line:

1) Select it in Anki
2) Press <kbd>Ctrl+b</kbd> to add subs and append media on it. (or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+b</kbd> to overwrite it)

To update a card from two or more subtitle lines:

1) Select it in Anki
2) Press <kbd>a</kbd> to open advanced menu.
3) Press <kbd>c</kbd> to start interactive selection.
4) Seek to the previous/next subtitle with <kbd>Shift+h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+l</kbd>.
5) Press <kbd>b</kbd> to add subs and append media on it. (or <kbd>Shift+b</kbd> to overwrite it)

The maximum of selected cards (for your deck's safety) is set to only one by default.
This behavior can be changed in config with `card_overwrite_safeguard`.
Just remember, if you have multiple cards with the same sentence (and the same audio recording), that's typically a bad practice.

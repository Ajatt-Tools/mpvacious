# Quick Card Creation

The goal of the quick card creation menu is to streamline a specific flow for media with **well-timed subtitles**:

1) Add a new note to Anki via
   [Rikaitan](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-yomichan.html)
   or any other tool that works with AnkiConnect.
2) Update the note via mpvacious.

To update the most recently added card from the currently visible subtitle line, press <kbd>gg</kbd>.

To make a card from two or more subtitle lines:

1) Press <kbd>g</kbd> to open the quick card creation menu.
2) Press any number <kbd>[2-9]</kbd>. This number corresponds to the number of lines to create the card from.

Note: <kbd>g1</kbd> is also valid.
However, <kbd>gg</kbd> is an additional bind to further streamline the most common scenario.

For example,
<kbd>g2</kbd> creates a card using 2 subtitle lines.

Like the advanced menu, you can also update multiple cards:

1) Press <kbd>Alt+g</kbd> to select the number of cards for quick card creation.
2) Press any number <kbd>[2-9]</kbd>. This number corresponds to the number of cards to update.
3) Press any number <kbd>[1-9]</kbd> again. This is the number of lines.

Note: upon completing the note update, the selected number of cards resets back to the default of one.

For example, <kbd>(Alt+g)22</kbd> would update the last 2 notes using 2 subtitle lines.

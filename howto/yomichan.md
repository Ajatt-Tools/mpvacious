# Modifying cards added with Rikaitan

You can add a card first using
[Rikaitan](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-yomichan.html),
and then append an audio clip and a picture to it.

1) Press <kbd>a</kbd> to open `advanced menu`.
1) Press <kbd>t</kbd> to toggle the `autoclip` option.

Now as subtitles appear on the screen, they will be immediately copied to the clipboard.
You can use it in combination with clipboard monitor.

1) Open [Rikaitan Search](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/what-is-yomichan-search)
   by pressing <kbd>Alt+Insert</kbd> in your web browser.
1) Play a video in `mpv`.
1) When you find an unknown word, click the <kbd>+</kbd> button to make a card for it.
4) Go back to mpv and add an image and an audio clip
   to the card you've just made by pressing <kbd>m</kbd> while the `advanced menu` is open.
   Pressing <kbd>Shift+m</kbd> will overwrite any existing data in media fields.

Don't forget to set the right timings and join lines together
if the sentence is split between multiple subs.
To do it, enter interactive selection by pressing <kbd>c</kbd>
and seek to the next or previous subtitle.

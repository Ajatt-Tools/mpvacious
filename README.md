Install all dependencies at once (on [Arch-based](https://www.parabola.nu/)
[distros](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html)):

```
$ sudo pacman -Syu mpv anki curl xclip --needed
```

## Prerequisites

* A guide on how to set up Anki can be found [on our site](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-anki.html).
  Note that it is not recommended to use FlatPak or similar containers.
* If you're on a [Windows](https://www.fsf.org/windows) or a [Windows-like](https://reactos.org/) machine,
  a mpv build by `shinchiro` is recommended.
* **macOS** users are advised to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or manually add `mpv` to `PATH`.
* Make sure that your build of mpv supports encoding of audio and images.
  This shell command can be used to test it.

  ```
  $ mpv 'test_video.mkv' --loop-file=no --frames=1 -o='test_image.jpg'
  ```

  If the command fails, find a compatible build on the [mpv website](https://mpv.io/installation/)
  or instead install FFmpeg and [enable FFmpeg support](#configuration) in `mpvacious`'s config file.

  Most problems with adding audio or images to Anki cards can be fixed by installing and enabling FFmpeg separately.

## Installation

There are multiple ways you can install `mpvacious`.
I recommend installing with `git` so that you can easily update on demand.

`mpvacious` is a user-script for mpv,
so it has to be installed in the directory `mpv` reads its user-scripts from.

| OS        | Location                                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GNU/Linux | `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`                         |
| Windows   | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/` |

Windows is not recommended,
but we acknowledge that some people haven't switched to GNU/Linux yet.

### Using git

Clone the repo to the `scripts` directory.

```
$ git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious.git' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/subs2srs
```

To update, run the following command.

```
cd ~/.config/mpv/scripts/subs2srs && git pull
```

### From the AUR

`mpvacious` can be installed with the [mpv-mpvacious](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpv-mpvacious/) package.

### Manually

Download
[the repository](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
or
[the latest release](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/releases)
and extract the folder containing
[subs2srs.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/master/subs2srs.lua)
to your [mpv scripts](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts) directory.

<details>

<summary>Expected directory tree</summary>

```
~/.config/mpv/scripts
|-- other script 1
|-- other script 2
|-- subs2srs
|   |-- main.lua
|   |-- subs2srs.lua
|   `-- other files
`-- other script 3
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>A note for mpv v0.32 and older</summary>

Older versions of `mpv` don't know how to handle user-scripts in subdirectories.
You need to tell mpv where to look for `mpvacious`.

Open or create  `~/.config/mpv/scripts/modules.lua` and add these lines:
```
local mpv_scripts_dir_path = os.getenv("HOME") ..  "/.config/mpv/scripts/"
package.path = package.path .. ';' .. os.getenv("HOME") .. '/.config/mpv/scripts/subs2srs/?.lua'
function load(relative_path) dofile(mpv_scripts_dir_path .. relative_path) end
load("subs2srs/subs2srs.lua")
```

</details>

**Note:** in [Celluloid](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/celluloid/)
user scripts are installed in `/.config/celluloid/scripts/`.
When following the instructions above, replace `.config/mpv` with `.config/celluloid`
and optionally `subs2srs` with the name of the folder mpvacious is cloned into.

## Configuration

The config file should be created by the user, if needed.

| OS                 | Config location                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GNU/Linux          | `~/.config/mpv/script-opts/subs2srs.conf`                         |
| Windows            | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/script-opts/subs2srs.conf` |
| Windows (portable) | `mpv.exeフォルダ/portable_config/script-opts/subs2srs.conf`           |

If a parameter is not specified
in the config file, the default value will be used.
mpv doesn't tolerate spaces before and after `=`.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/blob/master/.github/RELEASE/subs2srs.conf">Example configuration file</a>
</p>

Sentence field should be first in the note type settings.
Otherwise, Anki won't allow mpvacious to add new notes.

**Tip**: Try [our official note type](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1557722832)
if you don't want to configure note fields yourself.
Alternatively, we have a collection of user-created note types, which you can browse
[here](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/AnkiNoteTypes).

If you are having problems playing media files on older mobile devices,
set `audio_format` to `mp3` and/or `snapshot_format` to `jpg`.
Otherwise, I recommend sticking with `opus` and `webp`,
as they greatly reduce the size of the generated files.

If no matter what mpvacious fails to create audio clips and/or snapshots,
change `use_ffmpeg` to `yes`.
By using ffmpeg instead of the encoder built in mpv you can work around most encoder issues.
You need to have ffmpeg installed for this to work.

### Key bindings

The user may change some global key bindings, though this step is not necessary.
See [Usage](#usage) for the explanation of what they do.

| OS        | Config location                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| GNU/Linux | `~/.config/mpv/input.conf`                         |
| Windows   | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/input.conf` |

Default bindings:

```
a            script-binding mpvacious-menu-open

Ctrl+n       script-binding mpvacious-export-note

Ctrl+m       script-binding mpvacious-update-last-note
Ctrl+M       script-binding mpvacious-overwrite-last-note

Ctrl+c       script-binding mpvacious-copy-sub-to-clipboard
Ctrl+t       script-binding mpvacious-autocopy-toggle

H            script-binding mpvacious-sub-seek-back
L            script-binding mpvacious-sub-seek-forward

Alt+h        script-binding mpvacious-sub-seek-back-pause
Alt+l        script-binding mpvacious-sub-seek-forward-pause

Ctrl+h       script-binding mpvacious-sub-rewind
Ctrl+H       script-binding mpvacious-sub-replay
Ctrl+L       script-binding mpvacious-sub-play-up-to-next

Ctrl+v       script-binding mpvacious-secondary-sid-toggle
Ctrl+k       script-binding mpvacious-secondary-sid-prev
Ctrl+j       script-binding mpvacious-secondary-sid-next
```

**Note:** A capital letter means that you need to press Shift in order to activate the corresponding binding.
For example, <kbd>Ctrl+M</kbd> actually means <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+m</kbd>.
mpv accepts both variants in `input.conf`.

## Usage

* [Create a card](howto/create_card.md)
* [Open the "Add" dialog](howto/add_dialog.md)
* [Usage with Yomichan](howto/yomichan.md)
* [Usage with GoldenDict](howto/goldendict.md)

### Global bindings

**Menu:**

* <kbd>a</kbd> - Open `advanced menu`.

**Enable\Disable animation:**

* <kbd>Ctrl+g</kbd> - If animation is enabled, animated snapshots will be generated instead of static images.
  Animated snapshot are like GIFs (just in a different format)
  and will capture the video from the start to the end times selected.

**Make a card:**

* <kbd>Ctrl+n</kbd> - Export a card with the currently visible subtitle line on the front.
Use this when your subs are well-timed,
and the target sentence doesn't span multiple subs.

**Update the last card:**

* <kbd>Ctrl+m</kbd> - Append to the media fields of the newly added Anki card.
* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+m</kbd> - Overwrite media fields of the newly added Anki card.

**Clipboard:**

* <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd> - Copy current subtitle string to the system clipboard.
* <kbd>Ctrl+t</kbd> - Toggle automatic copying of subtitles to the clipboard.

**Seeking:**

* <kbd>Shift+h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+l</kbd> - Seek to the previous or the next subtitle.
* <kbd>Alt+h</kbd> and <kbd>Alt+l</kbd> - Seek to the previous, or the next subtitle, and pause.
* <kbd>Ctrl+h</kbd> - Seek to the start of the currently visible subtitle. Use it if you missed something.
* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+h</kbd> - Replay current subtitle line, and pause.
* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+l</kbd> - Play until the end of the next subtitle, and pause. Useful for beginners who need
  to look up words in each and every dialogue line.

**Secondary subtitles:**

* <kbd>Ctrl+v</kbd> - Toggle visibility.
* <kbd>Ctrl+k</kbd> - Switch to the previous subtitle if it's not already selected.
* <kbd>Ctrl+j</kbd> - Switch to the next subtitle if it's not already selected.

### Menu options

Advanced menu has the following options:

* <kbd>c</kbd> - Interactive subtitle selection.
  The range of the currently displayed subtitle line is selected. The selection then grows both ways based on the following displayed lines.
  It does nothing if there are no subs on screen.

* <kbd>shift+s</kbd> - Set the start time to the current sub. The selection then grows forward based on the following displayed lines.
  The default selection spans across the range of the currently displayed subtitle line.
* <kbd>shift+e</kbd> - Set the end time to the current sub. The selection then grows backward based on the following displayed lines.
  The default selection spans across the range of the currently displayed subtitle line.

Then seek with <kbd>Shift+h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+l</kbd> to the previous/next line that you want to add.
Press <kbd>n</kbd> to make the card.

* <kbd>r</kbd> - Forget all previously saved timings and associated dialogs.

* <kbd>z</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+z</kbd> - Adjust subtitle delay.

If above fails, you have to manually set timings.
* <kbd>s</kbd> - Set the start time. The selection then grows forward based on the following displayed lines.
The default selection spans across the selected start point and the end of the subtitle line.
* <kbd>e</kbd> - Set the end time. The selection then grows backward based on the following displayed lines.
The default selection spans across the selected end point and the start of the subtitle line.

Then, as earlier, press <kbd>n</kbd> to make the card.

**Tip**: change playback speed by pressing <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>
to precisely mark start and end of the phrase.

### My subtitles are not in sync

If subs are badly timed, first, you could try to re-time them.
Read [Retiming subtitles](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/retiming-subtitles).
Or shift timings using key bindings provided by mpv (usually <kbd>z</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+z</kbd>).

### Example sentence card

With the addon you can make cards like this in just a few seconds.

![card-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69171671/92900057-e102d480-f40e-11ea-8cfc-b00848ca66ff.png)

### Audio cards

It is possible to make a card with just audio, and a picture
when subtitles for the show you are watching aren't available, for example.
mpv by default allows you to do a `1` second exact seek by pressing <kbd>Shift+LEFT</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+RIGHT</kbd>.
Open the mpvacious menu by pressing <kbd>a</kbd>, seek to the position you need, and set the timings.
Then press <kbd>g</kbd> to invoke the `Add Cards` dialog.
Here's a [video demonstration](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=BXhyckdHPGE).

If the show is hard-subbed, you can use
[transformers-ocr](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/mining-from-manga.html)
to recognize and add text to the card.

### Secondary subtitles

If you want to add a translation to your cards, and you have the subtitles in that language,
you can add them as secondary subtitles if you run `mpv` with `--secondary-sid=<sid>` parameter,
`sid` being the track identifier for the subtitle.

You also need to specify `secondary_field` in the [config file](#Configuration)
if it is different from the default.

If you want to load secondary subtitles **automatically**, don't modify the run parameters
and instead set the desired languages in the config file (`secondary_sub_lang` option).

Secondary subtitles will be visible when hovering over the top part of the `mpv` window.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69171671/188492261-909ba3e8-b82c-493f-88cf-0ec953dfcfe1.mp4

By pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> you can control secondary sid visibility without using the mouse.

### Other tools

If you don't like the default Yomichan Search tool, try:

* Clipboard Inserter browser add-on
([chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm))
([firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/clipboard-inserter/))
* A html page ([1](https://pastebin.com/zDY6s3NK)) ([2](https://pastebin.com/hZ4sawL4))
to paste the contents of your clipboard to

You can use any html page as long as it has \<body\>\</body\> in it.

### Additional mpv key bindings

I recommend adding these lines to your [input.conf](#key-bindings) for smoother experience.
```
# vim-like seeking
l seek 5
h seek -5
j seek -60
k seek 60

# Cycle between subtitle files
K cycle sub
J cycle sub down

# Add/subtract 50 ms delay from subs
Z add sub-delay +0.05
z add sub-delay -0.05

# Adjust timing to previous/next subtitle
X sub-step 1
x sub-step -1
```

## Profiles

Mpvacious supports config profiles.
To make use of them, create a new config file called `subs2srs_profiles.conf`
in the same folder as your [subs2srs.conf](#Configuration).
Inside the file, define available profile names (without `.conf`) and the name of the active profile:

```
profiles=subs2srs,english,german
active=subs2srs
```

In the example above, I have three profiles.
The first one is the default,
the second one is for learning English,
the third one is for learning German.

Then in the same folder create config files for each of the defined profiles.
For example, below is the contents of my `english.conf` file:

```
deck_name=English sentence mining
model_name=General
sentence_field=Question
audio_field=Audio
image_field=Extra
```

You don't have to redefine all settings in the new profile.
Specify only the ones you want to be different from the default.

To cycle profiles, open the advanced menu by pressing <kbd>a</kbd> and then press <kbd>p</kbd>.
At any time you can see what profile is active in the menu's status bar.
